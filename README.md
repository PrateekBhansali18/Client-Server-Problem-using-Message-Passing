# Client-Server-Problem-using-Message-Passing
Write a POSIX compliant C program(s). 
There is a client server application for message passing and logging, which comprises of 1 server and “n” clients. The applications are
meant to be running in a single system and exchange data using stateless communication (i.e., single message block should be passed and completed in a single communication loop). Every request from the clients to the server is replied to the client by the server. Every action is initiated by the client and acted upon by the server.
